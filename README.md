## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Excel Dashboard**
   - Open `Manufacture_Final(1).xlsx`
   - Link with `Manufacturing clean Data.xlsx`
   - Use slicers/filters for dynamic insights.

2. **SQL Script**
   - Run `SQL_Manufacture Project.sql` in your SQL environment.
   - Generate cleaned and structured tables for dashboards.

3. **Power BI / Tableau**
   - Open `.pbix` in Power BI Desktop or `.twbx` in Tableau.
   - Connect with cleaned dataset for interactive analysis.

## 🎯 Key Insights from Dashboards

- Track **production efficiency** and wastage %.
- Identify **top rejected machines** and defect sources.
- Compare **department-wise performance**.
- Analyze **employee-level rejection rates**.
- Monitor **monthly production trends** to improve planning.
